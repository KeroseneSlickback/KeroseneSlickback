## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Will from America, based in Yamagata Japan. I'm a Fullstack Developer with a great interest in learning all sorts of interesting technology I can get my hands on. My main focus is in the frontend with design work and intergrated systems, but I'm known to get my hands dirty making APIs and messing with databases. I'm a passionate problem solver, always willing to dive into an issue and figure out great solutions.
